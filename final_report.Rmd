# Model Training
*In this section, describe the models you used to predict the time to recovery from COVID-19. Briefly state the assumptions made by using the models. Provide a detailed description of the model training procedure and how you obtained the final model.*


# Results
*In this section, report the final model you built to predict the time to recovery from COVID-19. Interpret the model and assess its performance.*


# Conclusions
*In this section, summarize your findings from the model analysis and discuss the insights gained into predicting time to recovery from COVID-19.*

# Additional Considerations
*In your modeling efforts, did you include "study" as a predictor variable? Provide a rationale for your decision, considering the variable's relevance and potential impact on model accuracy and interpretability.*
